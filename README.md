Paper code is a coding tool built with the aim of simplifying your brainstorming-coding experience. As the name suggests Paper Code compresses the various steps involved in coding from scratch, into a simple 3 click process - Scan. Edit. Run. Paper code works on programming languages to bring your ideas from the chalk board into a reality. Owing to its highly versatile nature, Paper Code finds applications in multiple domains, ranging from personal use at home, to institutional use by instructors or evaluators.

## React app
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. The website UI is developed using react. 

## Flask API
Flask is a popular micro framework for building web applications. Since it is a micro-framework, it is very easy to use and lacks most of the advanced functionality which is found in a full-fledged framework. Therefore, building a REST API in Flask is very simple.
For this website, user upload a image as a input. But in the code editor code should be in the text format. By using flask api, we tried to convert uploaded image into the text. 

## Google vision API
Cloud Vision allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content. We have used it to convert the image of the code into text format. We tried different OCR models but google vision api is giving good accuracy. So we have chosen it for our project.

## Deployment of the website
Render is a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with free TLS certificates, a global CDN, DDoS protection, private networks, and auto deploys from Git. We have hosted our backend (API) and frontend (react app) on render.
